#### Purpose

* Begin learning about Node.js environment


~~Note: Not adding node_modules directory to .gitignore: haven't learned to build a package yet.  This probably means that node_modules is incomplete.~~ [(Medium post about checking in node_modules)](https://medium.com/@kasajian/npm-install-2a0bc73a464b#.awrhde8gj)

 No need for node_modules here, refer to lessons in [Node School's learnyounode workshopper](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode).
